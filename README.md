# mobware-minigames
Repo for Mobware Minigames for the Playdate!


Designed for the Playdate, this framework will allow you to compile your own minigame and play it within the overarching minigame framework.

The Mobware Minigames minigame framework will load a minigame which is programmed similar to a normal playdate game. See the minigame template in the minigame folder for details!

To get started, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aloebach/mobware-minigames.git`

You can rename and edit the `minigame_template` folder and `minigame_template.lua` to use it as a template for your own minigame.

To compile and run the pdx game file, use the following shell command:
`pdc ./source mobware-minigames.pdx && open mobware-minigames.pdx`

Once you've cloned the repository, open Minigames/minigame-template and follow the instructions from there! After you've set up your own minigame using the template, you can set the `DEBUG_GAME` variable in `main.lua` to the name of your minigame to test. 



## Minigame guidelines 
* Minigames should last no longer than 10 seconds.
* The minigame should be in its own folder under "Minigames", and the <minigame_name> folder should have the same name as <minigame_name>.lua. 
* All necessary files such a libraries, music and image files should be contained within the individual minigame's folder, and the games can reference them accordingly. 
* <minigame_name>.lua should start by defining the minigame package (ex. `<minigame_name> = {}`) and end with returning the minigame package (ex. `return <minigame_name>`). See the minigame template for reference. 
* <minigame_name>.lua must contain the function <minigame_name>.update(), similar to playdate.update(), which is called once every frame.
* <minigame_name>.update() should return a 1 if the player won, or a 0 if the player lost.
* Playdate's additional callback functions are supported, but will be similarly named the <minigame_name> equivalent, such as <minigame_name>.cranked(change, acceleratedChange)
* credits.json should be in the minigame's root folder and contain the credits for your minigame to be included in the overall game's final credits sequence.
* credits.gif should be a Gif to be displayed for your minigame in the credits sequence. It should be in the minigame's root folder and be no larger than 180 x 180.
* The Mobware Minigames framework will begin running at 20 fps and gradually increase to 40 fps as the player progresses. Keep this in mind when programming your minigame so that it scales in difficulty accordingly and is playable both at 20 and 40 fps (and every frame rate in between).
